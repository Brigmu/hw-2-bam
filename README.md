Personal Portfolio

Description:

This project is a follow up of the previous portfolio project with the goal of making the website more responsive.  Bootstrap grid was used to allow elements to move around when the user resizes the website.  Future of this project is to make it so portfolio links actually go to somewhere (projects created in the future), and contact will be able to be submitted.

Installation:

Nothing major required other than an internet browser.  All of the functions of the website can be used from: brigmu.github.io/hw-2-bam.

Usage:

Usage of this project is straightforward. Go to the website provided in the last section and use a nav bar (about, portfolio, or contact) to navigate between pages and information on the site. Resize to see how site responds.

Credits:

Bootstrap: imported bootstrap to allow functionality
VS code: used to make all of the elements of this website.
Total Subtle Patterns: used for background of the website.
