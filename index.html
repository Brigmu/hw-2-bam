                    <p>My name is Brigham Mueller and this website was made to tell a little bit about myself and show what
                        I can do. I am an aspiring web designer, gamer, home chef, and dad joke extraordinaire.
                        Coding and designing have always been something that have peaked my interest as a way to explore my
                        creative side while still being a relevant way to make a living. Outside of my time learning and
                        growing my coding experience you can find me, as mentioned, two places: on the computer gaming or in
                        the kitchen.
                        Gaming for me has always been a way to be competitive and enjoy myself at the same time. It was also
                        how I connected with a lot of my siblings and gave us a means to spend time together.
                        My time in the kitchen is often spent trying new recipes or perfecting ones I already know. I get a
                        lot of satisfactin out of the enjoyent that other people get when they eat what I have made.
                    </p>
                    <p>Aside from my 3 main interests I love to play soccer, travel, and hang out with my family. Family is
                        super important to me and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. We love to play board
                        games, word games, video games, or pretty much anything where we can have a good time together.
                        I have traveled many places around the world including: China, Ukraine, Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico,
                        and Canada. My family is really into soccer and I personally played for about 13 years growing up on
                        very competitive teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>Beyond my personal interests, I am a very logical person who likes to think through pretty much
                        everything I do. I believe in being a kind person to everyone around me and try to help out as much
                        as I can.</p>
